/**
 * SparseMerkleTree class provides all the functions to create a sparse Merkle tree
 * and to take advantage of its features: {@linkcode SMT.add}, {@linkcode SMT.get},
 * {@linkcode SMT.update}, {@linkcode SMT.delete}, {@linkcode SMT.createProof},
 * {@linkcode SMT.verifyProof}.
 * To better understand the code below it may be useful to describe the terminology used:
 * * **nodes**: every node in the tree is the hash of the two child nodes (`H(x, y)`);
 * * **root node**: the root node is the top hash and since it represents the whole data
 * structure it can be used to certify its integrity;
 * * **leaf nodes**: every leaf node is the hash of a key/value pair and an additional
 * value to mark the node as leaf node (`H(x, y, 1)`);
 * * **entry**: a tree entry is a key/value pair used to create the leaf nodes;
 * * **zero nodes**: a zero node is an hash of zeros and in this implementation `H(0,0) = 0`;
 * * **siblings**: the children of a parent node are siblings;
 * * **path**: every entry key is a number < 2^256 that can be converted in a binary number,
 * and this binary number is the path used to place the entry in the tree (1 or 0 define the
 * child node to choose);
 * * **matching node**: when an entry is not found and the path leads to another existing entry,
 * this entry is a matching entry and it has some of the first bits in common with the entry not found;
 * * **depth**: the depth of a node is the length of the path to its root.
